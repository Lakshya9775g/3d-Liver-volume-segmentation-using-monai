# 3d CT- volume-segmentation-using-monai

Segmentation of CT images in medical field is a very comman problem and done usng many difrent models. 
In this project we are going to use pytorch's Framework MONAI which is very good in feild of medical image segmentation and works on Nifti images.
we will we using MONAI's U-Net model to train on our dataset which is giving us good results.
