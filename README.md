# 3d CT- volume-segmentation-using-monai

Segmentation of CT images in the medical field is a common problem and It can be done using many different models. 
In this project, we are going to use Pytorch's Framework MONAI, which is very good in the field of medical image segmentation and works on Nifti images.
We will be using MONAI's U-Net model to train on our dataset, which is giving us good results.
